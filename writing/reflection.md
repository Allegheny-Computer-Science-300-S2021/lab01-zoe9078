## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### Computer Aided Drug Design

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 Computer aided drug design or CADD lets scientists study the effects that different chemical compounds have in relationship to one another. It helps scientists understand complex chemical and biological processes without having to have the equipment and time they may normally need to make the same discoveries in a labratory settings.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 It uses algorithms that simulate chemical reactions and interactions. It finds possible drug matches that may solve the problem the users are looking into.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
It saves time and money when attempting to design drugs. During Covid this is especially important as we search for treatments to help the numerous people suffering from this pandemic. Without tools like this to help us we would be taking even longer to recover from this pandemic.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
If it was used inappropriately it could be used to find drugs that harm people instead of help them. This tool could, in the hands of a corrupt government or group, be used to automate some of the processes in bio-medical warfare. The last thing we want is a faster way to find new chemicals to harm people, so we should be careful and mindful of how we use this tool.
